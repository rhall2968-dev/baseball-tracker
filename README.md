# Fantasy Baseball Tracker

Automated scorekeeper for our 2026 best-ball fantasy baseball league. 8 teams, 13 batters each, top 10 count toward each period's score. Stats sync daily from the MLB Stats API.

**Live site:** [https://rhall2968-dev.github.io/baseball-tracker/]

## League Format

- **8 teams**, $25 buy-in, 13 batters drafted per team
- **Best ball**: top 10 of 13 players count each period
- **Scoring**: Total Bases + Stolen Bases + Walks + Hit By Pitch
- **3 periods** with redrafts on May 31 and Jul 31
- **Payouts**: each period winner + cumulative season winner

## Features

- League standings with cumulative + per-period rankings
- Team detail pages with full roster, scoring trend chart, best-ball indicators
- Player leaderboard with sortable columns (TB / SB / BB / HBP / PTS / PTS/G)
- Hot/cold indicators based on last 3 games vs season average
- CSV export for all player stats
- Mobile responsive
- Daily auto-sync via GitHub Actions

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **SQLite** via better-sqlite3 (committed to repo, ~80KB)
- **Recharts** for trend visualization
- **MLB Stats API** (statsapi.mlb.com — free, no key)
- **GitHub Actions + Pages** for hosting and daily sync

## How It Works

The site is built two ways from the same codebase:

1. **Local dev** (`npm run dev`) — full Next.js app with API routes hitting SQLite directly
2. **GitHub Pages** — static export with all data pre-generated to JSON files

The data layer (`src/lib/data.ts`) auto-detects which mode it's in.

### Daily Sync Flow

A GitHub Action runs every day at midnight PT:
1. Pulls the repo (with the existing `baseball.db`)
2. Runs `scripts/sync-and-build.ts` — fetches yesterday's MLB boxscores, upserts new stats
3. Regenerates static JSON files in `public/data/`
4. Commits the updated DB and JSON back to the repo
5. Builds the static site and deploys to GitHub Pages

This means daily runs take ~30 seconds (only fetching new games, not the whole season).

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

To seed the database from scratch (only needed if `baseball.db` is missing):
```bash
npx tsx src/db/seed.ts
```

To manually backfill or sync stats:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/sync-and-build.ts
```
